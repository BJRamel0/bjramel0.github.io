<h2> 1. Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to the WOD page for further details (from Dr. Port's GitHub repository)</h2>
<p> <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html">WOD 5.1</a> was designed to use variables in place of hard-coding so maintaining and changing the website is easier. </p>
<h2>2. Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down?</h2>
<p> In my experience in performing the WOD, it was way easier than I had expected. There was nothing that I struggled with developing. </p>
<h2>3. Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WODs before this?</h2>
<p> To prepare for the WOD, I prepped the files in advance so that any potential issues during the performance of the WOD were because of me and not the files. What I did similarly, compared to previous WODs, was that I had outlined what I needed to do and researched little things that I forgot. What I did differently, was my efficiency of the shortcut usage. My efficiency of the replace feature makes the process really quick.</p>
<h2>4. Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.</h2>
<p>What I could have done better was optimize my shortcut usage. I have been practicing since WOD3.1 but I can go way faster. So next time, I plan on trying to be more efficient with my keyboard when typing.</p>
