<p> <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html">WOD 5.1</a> was designed to showcase the usage of variables in place of hard-coding so that maintaining and changing the website is easier. In my experience in performing the WOD, it was way easier than I had expected. There was nothing that I struggled with developing. To prepare for the WOD, I prepped the files in advance so that any potential issues during the performance of the WOD were because of me and not the files. What I did similarly, compared to previous WODs, was that I had outlined what I needed to do and researched little things that I forgot. What I did differently, was my efficiency of the shortcut usage. My efficiency of the replace feature makes the process really quick. What I could have done better was optimize my shortcut usage. I have been practicing since WOD3.1 but I can go way faster. So next time, I plan on trying to be more efficient with my keyboard when typing. </p>
