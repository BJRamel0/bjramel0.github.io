My name is BJ Angelo Ramel, and I plan on double majoring in Management and Management Information Systems (MIS). Initially, I intended to major in Management and International Business, but MIS was always on my mind. Due to my prior experience in programming languages and my interests in design and technology, I thought MIS would be a good fit for me.
